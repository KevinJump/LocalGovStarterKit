Localgov Open311 - Inquiry API for Umbraco
--

An initial draft of the Open311 Inquiry protocol for umbraco sites. 

The plugin produces a Open311 compatible xml (or json) file listing all the 
services within a site, because this has a slight UK bias, it also allows you
to use the ESD Service ID as the ID for your service, this means service ids 
would be consistant between localgov sites, so you could collate information 
betterer.
