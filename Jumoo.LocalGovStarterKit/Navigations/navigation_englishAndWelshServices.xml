In England and Wales access authorities have been appointed to manage the opening-up of Access Land to the public. The Access Authority is responsible for identifying potential areas of Access Land and enforcing the opening of these areas; it is also responsible for improving and maintaining access to Access Land, e.g. by installing new gates or causing obstructions to be removed. In National Parks, the Access Authority is the relevant National Park Authority; elsewhere, it is the local highway authority. The Countryside Agency is responsible for maintaining the definitive map of Access Land.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service></Services></WebsiteNavigation><WebsiteNavigation><Identifier>65</Identifier><Label>Pollution</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/website navigation/65</URI><Description></Description><Created>2013-10-02T17:43:17.470</Created><Modified>2013-10-02T17:43:17.470</Modified><Type>Website navigation</Type><Services><Service><Identifier>413</Identifier><Label>Air quality</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/413</URI><Description>Each council has responsibility for measuring the quality of ambient air to ensure that it meets required standards in relation to the concentration of a defined range of pollutants such as lead, nitrogen dioxide, benzene etc. The local authority is also required to keep a copy of any orders made under relevant legislation.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>415</Identifier><Label>Asbestos management</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/415</URI><Description>Residents and business may be given advice on what to do if they believe asbestos may be present in a building.
